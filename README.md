OBD: Ontology of Bipolar Disorder
  
  Bipolar disorder results from a combination of genetic, social factors, personal characteristics, and brain function. The complex clinical manifestations of bipolar disorder pose challenges in medical diagnosis. To integrate the  large amounts of heterogeneous bipolar disease knowledge, data, and metadata from different data sources, we propose the development of an interoperable ontology of bipolar disorder (OBD) as a systematic framework to integrate these diverse resources. The Currently, OBD seamlessly reuses and integrates 171 terms from 5 reference ontologies under the upper-level Basic Formal Ontology. We also developed an ontological model interlinking different components together. As use cases, we demonstrated how OBD can be applied to map out the genetic predispositions and clinical symptoms of BD, facilitating more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. Overall, OBD supports the FAIR principles and supports advanced bipolar disorder study.
